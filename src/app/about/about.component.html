                Change is inevitable. What is also inevitable is failure for those who refuse to change - Dr. Trovis J
                Hedrick
                As we usher in the promising year of 2024, lot of expectations and challenges lies ahead in the
                education world. Proper upskilling, instilling respect for diverse understanding, discipline, honesty
                and focused learning are some of the challenges we expect to inculcate within each child. In this
                context, with great enthusiasm and optimism that I extend my warmest greetings to our dedicated faculty,
                diligent students, supportive parents, and esteemed staff.
                As we stand on the threshold of a new academic year, let us reflect on the achievements and challenges
                that have shaped our school in the past. Our shared commitment to excellence, collaboration, and growth
                has been the driving force behind our accomplishments, and I am confident that together, we will
                continue to build upon this strong foundation.

                The year 2023 was marked by resilience, adaptability, and a collective spirit that propelled us forward
                despite unforeseen circumstances. Our students demonstrated remarkable tenacity in the face of
                challenges, and our faculty and staff exhibited unwavering dedication to providing a nurturing and
                enriching learning environment.

                Looking ahead, our focus remains steadfast on fostering holistic development, academic excellence, and a
                sense of community within our school. We will continue to invest in innovative teaching methodologies,
                technology integration, and extracurricular activities that empower our students to become well-rounded
                individuals prepared for the demands of the future.

                I encourage each member of the Carmel family to embrace the opportunities and possibilities that the new
                year brings. Let us approach our academic pursuits with curiosity, our relationships with empathy, and
                our challenges with resilience. Together, we will create a vibrant and inclusive learning community that
                celebrates diversity and encourages each individual to reach their fullest potential.

                As we embark on this exciting journey into 2024, I extend my heartfelt gratitude to our parents for
                their unwavering support, our students for their boundless enthusiasm, and our faculty and staff for
                their tireless dedication.

                May this year be filled with joy, growth, and meaningful achievements for each member of the Gregorian
                community. Let us work hand in hand to make 2024 a year of inspiration, discovery, and success.

                Wishing you all a wonderful start to the academic year!

            <h2>Director's Message</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of education is to make good human beings with skill and expertise. Enlightened human beings
                can be created by teachers. - (A.P.J Abdul Kalam)

                Education is for life and not for living. But this exactly does not fit in today’s education system. We
                feel education is for living and not for life. We all know that how crucial role education play in
                shaping the lives of everyone. The present curriculum needs re-framing and overhauling. In the rat race
                we have forgotten that the end of education is to build a strong character to make a strong nation.We
                often see that a person holding degree of M.Sc. physics depends on an electrician to fix the fuse
                whereas an M.A. in English is unable to draft an application independently. Unfortunately we are still
                in the clutches of age old system of education that promotes clerical culture.Present day education
                system is not fulfilling its primary aim. It has just become a mean of passing information rather than
                transforming human beings. In other words, we can say that imparting education has turned artificial
                rather than heartifical. The time has come to re-design our pattern of education where we need not
                merely produce mechanical humans devoid of human values. Instead they should be taught about the
                uniqueness of Indian culture, value system, karma theory etc. from the very beginning stage of learning.
                Education must also focus on the basic values of living in unity in a society.In the present fast paced
                life, we fail to realize that today we are family but tomorrow when our children will have families,
                they will become society for their own children and ultimately we will be the first victim of the same.
                Let us teach our children the three very important values- Love for God, Fear of sin and Respect for the
                law of society. Now, we need to introspect, are we really teaching our children these core values? There
                is a dire need to teach our children about concern for nature-the ultimate creation of God. We belong to
                a country where we worship every bit of nature that is created by God but unfortunately we still rely on
                memorizing English rhymes in the initial stages of learning instead of emphasizing on teaching values to
                these tender minds. Instead of preaching them about sufferings, we must take them to the slums,
                orphanage, old age homes to inculcate in them the value of empathy. Children should be taught to abide
                the laws of society. They should be self-disciplined as while using their head and hands, they must
                listen to their inner conscience. Western world has already acknowledged our caliber and has adopted our
                way of living but we, in India still look towards them and follow them blindly leaving our culture and
                tradition behind.We always strive to make our children Great rather than making them Good.To incorporate
                values in young minds, we need to nourish them with ethics in harmony with the changes taking place in
                the modern world. It should be a blend of modern and traditional values. If we, the facilitators will
                not take this responsibility to guide this bizarre generation, then the day is not far away when these
                children will bear the fruits of success in some foreign land using our own mother land just for their
                self-growth only. Let’s teach our children the 5D's concept of devotion, discrimination between right
                and wrong, discipline, determination and duty. Besides this, we need to instill in students a deep faith
                for their teachers as it is going to have positive and long lasting impact and make them worthy citizens
                of New Bharat. Teacher’s community must gear up to face the challenges and educate the children to adopt
                4F's in their lives i.e. follow the master, face the devil (prevailing evils in oneself or in the
                society), fight till end and finish the game.
